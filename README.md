# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You‚Äôll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` ‚Äî to launch the server

`npm run dev` ‚Äî to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains the **backend server** for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application.  
The WTWR app helps users decide what to wear based on the weather forecast. While the frontend displays weather data and clothing suggestions, **this backend project focuses on building the server, database, and API that power those features**.

### Key Functionalities

- Provides a RESTful API for the WTWR frontend
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Stores and manages user data and clothing items in a database
- Fetches and processes weather data for use in the app
- Implements secure data handling practices

The eventual goal of this project is to create a **fully functioning server with API endpoints and user authorization**, deployed on a remote machine.
